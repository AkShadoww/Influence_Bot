"""
Reading what creators write back.

Resend only sends. A creator who answers a chase by hitting reply lands in a
human inbox the bot never reads, so the ladder keeps climbing past someone who
already said "posting Friday" — and the D+7 final notice goes out to a person
who answered on D+2. This module closes that loop.

Each chase email carries a per-chase ``Reply-To`` of the form
``chase+<token>@<CHASE_REPLY_DOMAIN>``. Resend routes replies to that domain
into ``POST /webhook/resend``, and the token identifies exactly which creator
on which campaign is replying — far better than guessing from the ``From:``
address, which changes, is shared, and cannot distinguish two campaigns the
same creator is running.

What happens to a reply, in order:

1. **Verify the signature.** This path can move a contracted deadline, so an
   unsigned or badly signed request is refused outright. The bot's older
   ``/webhook`` route trusts any POST that reaches it; that pattern must not
   be copied here.
2. **Fetch the body.** The inbound webhook carries metadata only — sender,
   recipients, subject, attachment list. The text is fetched from the
   receiving API by email id.
3. **Read it.** Claude classifies the reply and, when the creator commits to a
   date, extracts it.
4. **Propose, never apply.** A deadline is a contract term. The result is
   posted to Slack as a *proposal* with a Confirm button; nothing reaches the
   dashboard until a person clicks it. An LLM reading an email is not
   authority to rewrite an agreement.

Every reply reaches Slack whatever happens — an unreadable body, a failed
classification, a missing API key. A creator's answer is never silently
dropped; at worst the team sees the raw text and decides for itself.

- Resolve relative dates against the reply date given to you, and prefer the \
nearest future reading: "Tuesday" means the coming Tuesday.
- If they say the content is already live, that is `says_already_posted` even \
if they also give a date — the team needs to check the links, not reschedule.
- If they are pulling out, cancelling, or saying they cannot do it, that is \
`cannot_deliver`, whatever else the message contains.
